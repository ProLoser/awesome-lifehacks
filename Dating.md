# Dating

## Standing Out
Evolution is about competition when you distill it down to a basic level. On a pure probability level it is statistically impossible for you to always be the smartest/fittest/hottest in the room in every room. But under that same probability it is really easy to NOT be the least in the room. This is because the average majority of people simply do not care or they are unable to maintain. Those who pursue this as their primary goal compromise their other life values.
Instead, live intentionally and maximize your existence. Whatever you pursue, due so with conviction and optimism. You will never stand out if you are like everybody else living life "incidentally" between streaming shows on Netflix and swiping through posts. Do not live to pursue but instead pursue embetterment of yourself and see who appreciates and can match the energy you create. 

## Meeting Someone New

### Archive Conversations
Sometimes we get impatient when we eagerly wait for someone to respond to a message. To help with [patience](#patience), try archiving the conversation after your last unanswered question. This will help prevent you from being reminded about the lack of response whenever you open the app. Out of sight, out of mind.

### Be Positive
Sometimes dating can be frustrated. When you meet someone new, try to make your introductions and descriptions positive. With the sheer number of options people are faced with these days, they won't want to spend time on someone who doesn't seem like they're going to bring happiness into their life right off the bat.
Do not bring negativity to your date or relationship for resolution. Understanding the past and making informed decisions is important. Fixating on the past and letting it affect your emotions in the present will not help.

### It's only a problem if you make it a problem
Frequently people will lament or worry about traits or habits about themselves that they feel someone else may not like. Weight, height, etc. If the person you're interested in doesn't mention it as an issue, then you shouldn't either. You'll only end up putting a negative opinion into their head when in fact they may have never been thinking about it in the first place.

### Patience
People have lives. When someone returns to a conversation, the last thing they'll want is to be greeted by a wall of self-doubting neuroticism when they had no mal-intentions. Remember, try to always [be positive](#be-positive).

## Relationships

### Facts vs Feelings

### Win the fight, lose the relationship
Try to remind yourself about your bigger goal when you're fighting. The point isn't to win the argument, the point is to make the relationship succeed. The best way to accomplish this is to remind yourself what you really want in the relationship, and not just how you feel at that exact moment. Try to deliberately lose the fight as quickly as possible and you'll find both you and your partner will be able to resolve things more easily.
