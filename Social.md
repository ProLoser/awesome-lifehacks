## Eye Contact is a Tool
disconnect your ego from your eye contact and you can learn many things about people. 

It is the closest thing to The Force that you can achieve in reality. It is a question of intention and probability.

State at someone long enough and they will move. Ignore eye contact and they will stop talking to you. But this is how animals communicate, through non verbal intention.

Treat it as a social experiment to see how beings react. Can you use eye contact to do telekinesis? What is normal? What is weird? why should anyone care?

If you lived your life with blindness and suddenly could see, you would stare at every little detail of the world in wreckless abandon. The same feels true of Lasik.

Your vision is a tool for safety and to understand the world around you. don't artificially censor it out of fear.

### Watergun for hot days
Carry a small watergun with you on hot days to squirt overheating dogs on the sidewalk. Assuming their owners don't mind.
