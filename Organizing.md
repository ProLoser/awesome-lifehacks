# Organizing

Inspirations: Adam Savage, Marie Condo

## [First Order Retrievability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyCrHLYiGNo)
The items you use most frequently should be the most accessible. 
Everything in your inventory should be visible at a glance, nothing should be hidden or tucked behind. 
Items should be put into groups that work independently and are mobile and organized.

Marie Kondo that shi*

Be honest with yourself when it's time to let go. Kill your darlings. 
Those ideas that have dragged on far too long and will never go anywhere and only serve as emotional weight.

## Piles
Dump everything in your room out into one pile in the center of the room. Empty all your containers, your bags, everything into this pile.

Start organizing the pile into smaller purpose-based piles, and place all your containers together ordered by size.

As you complete piles for appropriate purposes or spaces, find the smallest container that fits all the items in the pile and combine them together.

## Go Bags
maintain task-oriented bags that contain all the essential tools necessary for a task or activity (sports, work, art, etc)

do not share items across bags, instead leverage duplicates so that a go bag is fully encapsulating and complete.

reexamine usefulness and organization as needed at regular intervals 

ritualize refilling your go bags and cleaning and prepping upon completing the activity so that you are unencumbered when the fancy strikes you grab and go

## [Clean one thing at a time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g82rr1AIm0Q)
Just focus on one thing at a time.
Have a home for everything. Where would you need it?
That way you will always know when something is missing.
Take sollace and embrace the tedium. Do not rush yourself. Build better habits step by step.
