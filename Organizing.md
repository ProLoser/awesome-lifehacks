# Organizing

Inspirations: Adam Savage, Marie Condo

## [First Order Retrievability](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=first+order+retrievability)
The items you use most frequently should be the most accessible. 
Everything in your inventory should be visible at a glance, nothing should be hidden or tucked behind. 
Items should be put into groups that work independently and are mobile and organized.

## Ask Yourself If It Sparks Joy

Be honest with yourself when it's time to let go. Kill your darlings. 
Those ideas that have dragged on far too long and will never go anywhere and only serve as emotional weight.

## Piles
Dump everything in your room out into one pile in the center of the room. Empty all your containers, your bags, everything into this pile.

Start organizing the pile into smaller purpose-based piles, and place all your containers together ordered by size.

As you complete piles for appropriate purposes or spaces, find the smallest container that fits all the items in the pile and combine them together.
