# Productivity

### Make reminders to create todo tasks
If you don't have time to write down a new story, task, todo item, assignment and the related description, then simply set a reminder for yourself to create the task in an hour when you have 5 or 10 minutes to spare. Google, Siri and Slack all work with `remind me to... in an hour`

### Frontload Your Calendar
Schedule events as early as possible. This has multiple benefits:
- Easier to postpone meetings than reschedule sooner
- Flexibility to schedule follow-ups if necessary
- Meetings enable knowledge-sharing to unblock isolated productivity

### Priorities Evolve
- Understand tasks that have no "or else" and consider deleting, reorganizing or deprioritizing

### Battery Pomodoro 
[The Pomodoro Technique](https://www.pomodorotechnique.com/) is a Great way to focus on getting singular tasks done. 

Your laptop battery is an excellent timer, simply top off your device and then disconnect and go find a conducive place to work. Try to work continuously on completing at least one task but as many as you can. and yes reorganizing and going through email counts. work until the battery dies, and use that as a signal to take a break.

## Email

### Unsubscribe, Spam and Filter Effectively. Don't just Delete.
Deleting garbage emails only blocks the individual email, whereas unsubscribing, marking as spam and filtering prevents all subsequent garbage from that sender. Yes, there's lots of spam, but this is a marathon, not a race. Better than doom-scrolling.

### Respond, Schedule, Prioritize
Emails typically should be handled immediately, scheduled in a calendar, or prioritized in a todo list. Otherwise arrive it if you may need it again and delete it if it's outdated or you can access the information reliably elsewhere.

### Declare Inbox Bankrupcy
If your unread email count is too massive, that's okay. You are not your inbox. Just pick a date after which you feel is reasonable and archive or delete everything before that point.

### Signup using Email Tags ([Sub-Addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_address#Sub-addressing))
Most email services support sub-addresses, or variations of your email address that forward to your normal inbox (but display the address the email was sent to).

When signing up for most websites and services, I try to tag the registration email with the entity that I'm signing up at: `dean@gmail.com` becomes `dean+bestbuy@gmail.com`

This allows me to systematically filter emails based on the address used, to further validate that the vendor is legitimate, as well as to keep track of how your email address becomes shared or distributed (legally or otherwise).

Finally, using distinct email addresses for every website or service is more secure than using the same address on multiple website. Unfortunately Open Authentication (using a partner to login) does not support customizing your email address before sharing it.

When a website or account is compromised, typically small, outdated or poorly secured systems like old forums, hackers will try to use the account credentials on multiple other popular services to see if the victim used the same credentials in multiple places. While simply using the same email address in multiple places isn't necessarily insecure, this approach gives you ability to better control how your information gets exposed to the web in a more proactive and actionable way.
