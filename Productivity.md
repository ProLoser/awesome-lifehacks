# Productivity

### Make reminders to create todo tasks
If you don't have time to write down a new story, task, todo item, assignment and the related description, then simply set a reminder for yourself to create the task in an hour when you have 5 or 10 minutes to spare. Google, Siri and Slack all work with `remind me to... in an hour`

### Frontload Your Calendar
Schedule events as early as possible. This has multiple benefits:
- Easier to postpone meetings than reschedule sooner
- Flexibility to schedule follow-ups if necessary
- Meetings enable knowledge-sharing to unblock isolated productivity

### Priorities Evolve
- Understand tasks that have no "or else" and consider deleting, reorganizing or deprioritizing

## Email

### Unsubscribe, Spam and Filter Effectively. Don't Delete.
Deleting garbage emails only blocks the individual email, whereas unsubscribing, marking as spam and filtering prevents all subsequent garbage from that sender. Yes, there's lots of spam, but this is a marathon, not a race. Better than doom-scrolling.

### Respond, Schedule, Prioritize
Emails typically should be handled immediately, scheduled in a calendar, or prioritized in a todo list. 

### Declare Inbox Bankrupcy
If your unread email count is too massive, that's okay. You are not your inbox. Just pick a date after which you feel is reasonable and archive or delete everything before that point.
