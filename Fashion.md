Beauty is in the eye of the beholder

## Life is too short for matching socks
All my socks either match identically or uniformly do not match each other. 
I also switched 100% to gym underwear so I'm always ready for a sweaty day at Disneyland

## Shoe Laces 
I take time to tie my shoes. after covid, it's a luxury I like to embrace and enjoy the ritual of.

### Dean's Quick Casual Hybrid
Great for boots and shoes with lots of eyelits, this technique can be mixed with any lacing to allow the wearer to quickly switch between a loose fit and a classic single tie bow fit without risk of tripping on open laces.

1. Lace your shoes to the top, leaving the last row of eyelits open. 
2. Tie the first half of a bow tie (cross laces) 
3. Instead of creating the ears of the bow and tying it off, lace the threads from front to back in the last row. 
4. Tie a single twist knot around the aglet (lace end) inside the shoe, pointing the end away from the foot and tucked to the side
5. Use shoe in current configuration for relaxed fit
6. Tighten all laces to the top and tie the rest of the bow fit a classic fit
7. Never worry about untied laces again

## Marie Kondo that shit 
If your clothing does not spark joy (usually you haven't worn it in over a year) donate it. make space for more opportunities to intentionally passively give yourself joy every day.

## Fashion isn't comfortable
This is Fact. Comfort can be improved but at the end of the day it's a decision:
"Do I care?"

## Accessibility Inspires
if you want to find matching pieces, blur your vision and hold your primary garment next to your other garments, sometimes I drag my article across the items in my rack. When you subconsciously feel something deep inside from the unrecognizable, stop and remove the piece.

*Explore it*

this feeling.
