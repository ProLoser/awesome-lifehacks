### Make reminders to create todo tasks
If you don't have time to write down a new story, task, todo item, assignment and the related description, then simply set a reminder for yourself to create the task in an hour when you have 5 or 10 minutes to spare. Google, Siri and Slack all work with `remind me to... in an hour`
