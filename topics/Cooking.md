### [Boneless, Skinless Chicken Thighs](Dieting.md#boneless-skinless-chicken-thighs)
This cut of meat is always easier to cook to jucier perfection than the breast meat counterpart. Try substituting in most of your chicken dishes and you'll find you're addicted to this healthy meat.

### Mushrooms
Cook mushrooms on high heat. Hold off on adding salt towards the end, otherwise they may shrivel and lose their juice.

If you plan to add onions, throw them in once the mushrooms start getting shiny.
