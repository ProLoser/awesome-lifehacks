# Dating

### Be Positive
Sometimes dating can be frustrated. When you meet someone new, try to make your introductions and descriptions positive. With the sheer number of options people are faced with these days, they won't want to spend time on someone who doesn't seem like they're going to bring happiness into their life right off the bat.

### It's only a problem if you make it a problem
Frequently people will lament or worry about traits or habits about themselves that they feel someone else may not like. Weight, height, etc. If the person you're interested in doesn't mention it as an issue, then you shouldn't either. You'll only end up putting a negative opinion into their head when in fact they may have never been thinking about it in the first place.

### Patience
People have lives. When someone returns to a conversation, the last thing they'll want is to be greeted by a wall of self-doubting neuroticism when they had no mal-intentions. Remember, try to always [be positive](#be-positive).
