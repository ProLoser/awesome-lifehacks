### Turn jeans inside out when washing

### Place heavier items in the bottom of the washer
If you have a top-down washer, you can prevent an uneven load by putting the heaviest items in at the bottom (jeans and towel). This will keep the center of gravity lower and reduce knocking.

It may also help to place these longer items in a loose ball so they don't wrap around the center post and stop the drum from spinning.
