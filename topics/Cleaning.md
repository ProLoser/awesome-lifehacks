### Place heavier items in the bottom of the washer
If you have a top-down washer, you can prevent an uneven load by putting the heaviest items in at the bottom (jeans and towel). This will keep the center of gravity lower and reduce knocking.

It may also help to place these longer items in a loose ball so they don't wrap around the center post and stop the drum from spinning.

### Turn jeans inside-out when washing
Allows the pockets and interior linings to dry off sooner.

### Turn some shirts/jackets inside-out to prevent pilling
The little beads of fibers you see after you've washed a garment a few times occur when the material is rubbed up against other articles during washing. Turning the garment inside out will reduce the amount of friction as the material should primarily rub against itself.
