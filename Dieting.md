# Dieting
A list of small ways to move the needle on your path to skinny

### 8oz Soda
If you have trouble weening off of soda, try the 8oz cans (and check out the versions with Real Sugar). It frequently ends up being enough for one serving.

### [Boneless, Skinless Chicken Thighs](Cooking.md#boneless-skinless-chicken-thighs)
These are slightly fattier (although still healthier than beef and pork) and always come out juicy. Try cooking at home with this meat and you'll find it's easier to cook your chicken jucier and tastier than with breast meat.

### Give away the last bite

### Leftovers
Try to plan to take home leftovers. If you find you can't help but order an appetizer, portion your plate pre-emptively so put together a full serving in a togo box.asdfasdf

Don't like leftovers? Take them with you anyway and leave them with someone living on the street.

### Pay extra 
Unfortunately, eating healthy can invariably be more expensive. If you're not hurting for funds, try switching your meat to shrimp or adding steak to your salad if you're aversed to the cardboard most places pass for chicken with salads.
