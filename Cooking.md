### [Boneless, Skinless Chicken Thighs](Dieting.md#boneless-skinless-chicken-thighs)
This cut of meat is always easier to cook to jucier perfection than the breast meat counterpart. Try substituting in most of your chicken dishes and you'll find you're addicted to this healthy meat.

### Mayonaise Marinade
Turn any dry rub or your favorite spice blend into a marinade by adding mayonaise. Mix the spices evenly into the mayo and make sure your food has an even coating. There won't be any lingering mayo taste as most of the oils cook away.

### Mushrooms
Cook mushrooms on high heat. Hold off on adding salt towards the end, otherwise they may shrivel and lose their juice.

If you plan to add onions, throw them in once the mushrooms start getting shiny.

### Watermelons
The *PROPER* way to pick the best melon: pick the heaviest melon for it's size. If the grocery store has a scale, try using it. The extra juice will give the melon more weight for its mass.

If you cut the melon in half, you can sometimes store the remaining half in a large mixing bowl with a cover in the fridge.

*For Parties:*
1. Cut the melon in half
2. Place the half melon face down onto a grooved cutting board
3. Cut rows of 1-2in slices across the melon
4. Turn 90deg and do it again
5. You can present the melon on the cutting board letting people use the rind as handles

> *Note:* Requires having an easy to access trash can or bowl for the rinds.

*For Snacking:*
1. Cut the melon in half
2. Place the half melon face down onto a grooved cutting board
3. Spend a few minutes with a sharp knife shaving off and disposing all the rind. You should have a bright red half-melon
4. Cut rows of 1-2in slices across the melon
5. Turn 90deg and do it again
6. Take a large mixing bowl and place it upside down over the half melon
7. While holding the cutting board and bowl, flip everything over
8. Hand out toothpicks or forks and let people grab spears from the bowl
9. Cover the bowl for easy fridge storage and eating later.
