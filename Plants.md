# Plants
Plants are a great way to meditate. they give you infinite opportunities to Foster and observe, nurture and inspire growth. 

The slow methodical ritual of tending to and watering your plants helps create a meditative rhythm.

Embrace the tedium. Don't rush the task. it's about the journey, not the destination.
