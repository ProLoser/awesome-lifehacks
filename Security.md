# Security

## Managing Passwords
Use a password manager keychain like Apple, Google or OnePassword.

Use a different, randomly generated, password for every website. You should only customize and memorize one password: the one to your keychain. Do not reuse or share this password anywhere with anyone. Any form of digitization or saving of this password should be considered a major security risk.

In exchange, compromising of your randomly generated password is negligible, as you can immediately sign back in and change to a new randomly generated password.

Logging in with Open Authintication (partner logins) are secure as your password is never shared with the service, but you cannot [customize your email using email tags](../Productivity.md#use-email-tags-sub-addresses) before it is shared with the partner.
