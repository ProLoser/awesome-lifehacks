## Managing Passwords
use a password manager like Apple, Google or one password 

use a different password for every website 

use oauth logins if you don't mind sharing your email with partner websites. 

you can customize your email address so that no two websites share the same email as well as same password. this also makes it easier to keep track of how your contact information is spread through different businesses and the internet
