## 7 Minute Workout
Why not 6 minutes? Why not 2 hours?

## Only Compete With Yourself
Actors are paid to go to the gym. The rest of us typically have careers and hobbies. Don't compare yourself to others. Only compare to yourself yesterday. That is the only person you are trying to beat. If you compare yourself to others, then eventually you may find that you are frequently the fittest, or hottest, or smartest, or tallest or _something_ in the room. But there will always be a room where you are not. So at the very least, challenge yourself to never be the worst in the room. And to acheive that you only have to attempt more than average. And the average today is people choosing not to challenge themselves with more than what netflix show to binge watch next.

## Break the Losing Streak
Don't focus on maintaining a winning streak of consecutive days of active fitness, this seems highly impossible to maintain long term and sets unrealistic expectations.
