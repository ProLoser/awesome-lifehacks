# Eating

## American Portions
Americans have huge portions which can make dieting difficult. When dining for 2, instead of buying separate entrees, consider ordering a full-course meal for 1 person and sharing. This will allow you to have half the portions while increasing the variety of dishes. If you don't have a partner, consider purchasing 2 lunch and dinner from one restaurant and splitting the meal in half before starting.

## Ordering
Ask employees the 2 most popular items. Trust customers who order the same thing twice. Look at the kitchen and avoid ordering dishes they would not excel at. Try to focus on items and ingredients made fresh and in-house.

## Sandwiches
Sandwiches have 2 flavors. turn the sandwich upside down to try the opposite flavor profile. The order in which the ingredient layers encounter your palette will create a completely different flavor profile.

### Eat Baklava Upside Down
An amazing balance chef once told me, and I realized this allows your tongue to hit the delicately crispy layers on the top of the pastry before becoming smothered in nuts and syrup

### Ratatouille Diet
Food is how we experience culture. I don't like artificially limit my existence. I practice moderation and prioritization. Consider the Ratatouille Critic Diet.

"I don't like food, I LOVE it. If I DONT love it I DONT swallow."

## Give away the last bite

## Pay extra 
Unfortunately, eating healthy can invariably be more expensive. If you're not hurting for funds, try switching your meat to shrimp or adding steak to your salad if you're aversed to the cardboard most places pass for chicken with salads.

## 8oz Soda cans
Try to get the ones with real sugar instead of HFCS
