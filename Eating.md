# Eating

## American Portions
Americans have huge portions which can make dieting difficult. When dining for 2, instead of buying separate entrees, consider ordering a full-course meal for 1 person and sharing. This will allow you to have half the portions while increasing the variety of dishes. If you don't have a partner, consider purchasing 2 lunch and dinner from one restaurant and splitting the meal in half before starting.

## Ordering
Ask employees the 2 most popular items. Trust customers who order the same thing twice. Look at the kitchen and avoid ordering dishes they would not excel at. Try to focus on items and ingredients made fresh and in-house.

## Sandwiches
most sandwiches have 2 flavors. turn the sandwich upside down to try the opposite flavor profile

### Ratatouille Diet
Food is how we experience culture. I don't like artificially limit my existence. I practice moderation and prioritization. Consider the Ratatouille Critic Diet.

"I don't like food, I LOVE it. If I DONT love it I DONT swallow."
- Anton Ego (Ratatouille 2007)

## 8oz Soda
If you have trouble weening off of soda, try the 8oz cans (and check out the versions with Real Sugar). It frequently ends up being enough for one serving.

## [Boneless, Skinless Chicken Thighs](Cooking.md#boneless-skinless-chicken-thighs)
These are slightly fattier (although still healthier than beef and pork) and always come out juicy. Try cooking at home with this meat and you'll find it's easier to cook your chicken jucier and tastier than with breast meat.

## Give away the last bite

## Pay extra 
Unfortunately, eating healthy can invariably be more expensive. If you're not hurting for funds, try switching your meat to shrimp or adding steak to your salad if you're aversed to the cardboard most places pass for chicken with salads.
