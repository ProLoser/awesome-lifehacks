# Eating

## American Portions
Americans have huge portions which can make dieting difficult. When dining for 2, instead of buying separate entrees, consider ordering a full-course meal for 1 person and sharing. This will allow you to have half the portions while increasing the variety of dishes.

## Ratatouille Diet
I refuse to do any form of diet because I believe food is how we experience culter and I would never want to artificially limit my existence. Instead, I choose to practice moderation and prioritization. So I ascribe to the Ratatouille Critic Diet.

"I don't like food, I LOVE it. If I DONT love it I DONT swallow."

## Sandwiches
most sandwiches have 2 flavors. turn the sandwich upside down to try the opposite flavor profile

## Ordering
sometimes waiters have terrible personal preferences. I always ask for the 2 most popular items as I trust customers who order the same thing twice more than anything else. sometimes all the options are terrible. try to look at the kitchen and staff and avoid ordering dishes the kitchen obviously would not excel at.
