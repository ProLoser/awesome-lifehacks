# Eating

## Sandwiches
most sandwiches have 2 flavors. turn the sandwich upside down to try the opposite flavor profile

## Ordering
sometimes waiters have terrible personal preferences. I always ask for the 2 most popular items as I trust customers who order the same thing twice more than anything else. sometimes all the options are terrible. try to look at the kitchen and staff and avoid ordering dishes the kitchen obviously would not excel at.
