# Eating

Food is how we experience culture.

## American Portions
Americans have huge portions which can make dieting difficult. When dining for 2, instead of buying separate entrees, consider ordering a full-course meal for 1 person and sharing. This will allow you to have half the portions while increasing the variety of dishes. If you don't have a partner, consider purchasing 2 lunch and dinner from one restaurant and splitting the meal in half before starting.

## Ordering
Ask employees the 2 most popular items. Trust customers who order the same thing twice. Look at the kitchen and avoid ordering dishes they would not excel at. Try to focus on items and ingredients made fresh and in-house.

## Sandwiches
Sandwiches have 2 flavors. turn the sandwich upside down to try the opposite flavor profile. The order in which the ingredient layers encounter your palette will create a completely different flavor profile.

### Eat Baklava Upside Down
An amazing balance chef once told me, and I realized this allows your tongue to hit the delicately crispy layers on the top of the pastry before becoming smothered in nuts and syrup

# Dieting

I don't believe in artificially limiting a mindful existence. 

I practice moderation and prioritization. 

## Ratatouille Diet

"I don't like food, I LOVE it. If I DONT love it I DONT swallow."
- Anton Ego (Ratatouille 2007)

## Eat Less, More Often 
Always order small, and spread your intake out throughout the day, maybe even across more locations.

Sometimes I will fast for a day just to allow more time to digest but be careful of binge ordering and eating when breaking your fast.

## Give away the last bite

## Pay extra 
Unfortunately, eating healthy can invariably be more expensive. If you're not hurting for funds, try switching your meat to shrimp or adding steak to your salad if you're aversed to the cardboard most places pass for chicken with salads.

## 8oz Soda cans
Try to get the ones with real sugar instead of HFCS

## Stop drinking sugar
The fastest way to increase calories anything less processed and less artificial will help

## Water Supplement
I have mixed feelings about most dietary supplements because it's so difficult to measure effectiveness and so easy to just mindlessly incorporate into the rest of your file for no meaningful reason other than placebo.

That said, a great way to eat less (unhealthy) food is to simply substitute it in which case water makes an excellent option so the most important detail is to take time and energy (and expense) to find an enjoyable form of consumption like a fancy water bottle that stays cold for 24 hours in your favorite colors. Anything to subconsciously encourage yourself to adopt healthier daily habits and rituals by reducing the perceived barrier to effort and increasing the perceived delight or associating the positive habit with emotional reward.
