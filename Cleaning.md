# Cleaning

### Clean from top to bottom
Clean up high to let grime fall down to the next surface. 
Eventually you will have all the dirt on the floor at which point I highly recommend a robot vacuum/mop with self refilling/cleaning base station.

## Dishwasher

### Hand Washing
If you prefer hand washing, consider focusing on your key cookware pieces and using the machine for common items:
- dinnerware 
- complex items 
- stained items

Use the "Rinse" cycle to prevent your dirty dishes from drying out over night if you want to wait until the machine is full before running a full wash cycle.

### Look at how you load the machine
You should look through the racks to confirm that dishes with the most grime are accessible to jets.
Keep dirtier items closer to the jets (near the center typically).
Seriously, look up a [youtube video](https://youtu.be/jHP942Livy0?si=IuwhrM9RhbpwHqQq).

#### Disable the "Extra Dry" Mode
If you have night dry or don't experience water spots, consider switching Extra Dry features off. These typically have a heated air dry mode at the end of the wash which will affect the lifespan of your dishes.

#### Consider "Express" Mode
If you find your dishes are effectively washed from regular use, consider using the "Express" mode which may decrease the amount of water and max temperature and duration of the wash while possibly yielding the same results.

## Washing Machine

### Place heavier items in the bottom of the washer
If you have a top-down washer, you can prevent an uneven load by putting the heaviest items in at the bottom (jeans and towels). This will keep the center of gravity lower and reduce knocking.

It may also help to place these longer items in a loose ball so they don't wrap around the center post and stop the drum from spinning.

### Turn jeans/pants inside-out when washing
Allows the pockets and interior linings to dry off sooner.

### Turn some shirts/jackets inside-out to prevent pilling
The little beads of fibers you see after you've washed a garment a few times occur when the material is rubbed up against other articles during washing. Turning the garment inside out will reduce the amount of friction as the material should primarily rub against itself.

### Dryer decreases lifespan
Consider "delicate" for most clothing options. Remove synthetics that dry early. Hang dry buttoned shirts (I usually  just put them on hangars on a rack)
