# Coding

## Work Life Balance
COVID allowed me to explore a new approach to worklife productivity balance. I found that it was extremely difficult to complete my coding tasks during a work day as the context switching in and out of meetings as well as reviewing and digesting challenges and feedback from other teams can mean it's extremely difficult to see any real progress when programming. When COVID hit, most stores were only open in the middle of the afternoon which forced me to attend meetings remotely while taking care of chores. I would then defer my programming time to a separate window in my schedule. I would frequently spend multiple days deliberately avoiding programming merely because I have so many meetings or chores. This enabled me to plan and network amongst my team and other dependencies before I finally choose to sit and code.
I ask questions, i take notes, and i do research while actively reviewing work of my teammates to keep them unblocked. This way no one can say that my priorities affect them. Finally, I plan to occasionally pull late nights or long hours focused purely on programming (or just going through emails) but in exchange I find I only ever need to do it once a week or on rare occasion. It's these opportunities where we can tunnel focus in on the task at hand uninterupted by other people and notifications that you will have the most effective momentum. If you have actively done as much prep and research and ideation and discussion you could before you alloted coding window, then you will find what you have to write flows freely and is unblock from your mind.

At the end of the day, you can only ask yourself to accomplish one thing. To move the needle. To hit the ball back into someone else's court. Not every ball, not every court. But challenge yourself with the lowest you can attain and see how far your momentum takes you.

## anti patterns
Code patterns are just tools. They are not typically good or bad, they are merely tools that we can choose to leverage or bias ourselves to avoid. Instead always be open to changing your perspective when given new information.

## Code Debt and Refactorability
The "R" word is not a 4 letter word although many managers seem to react that way.

Code debt exploration spikes although frequently incomplete are still extremely useful. I have left DRAFTs open years and find I am always able to come back and revisit this knowledge. Instead of forcing your team to adopt large painful changes, try to slice your draft into smaller pieces that can be used as fixes for bugs as they surface. This will help ground the effort in meaningful value for the end user and product managers.

Try to write code with the intention of refactoring. Anticipate future expectations of evolving behavior and try to adopt the relevant paradigms and patterns without increasing complexitly prematurely. It is always easier to make something simple more complicated than it is to make something complicated more simple.

Premature Optimization is like other Premature things... Emberrassing.

## 80/20 Rule
Focus on the 20% effort that would cover 80% of the results / users. Then identify the most frequent touch points when prioritizing remaining work.
