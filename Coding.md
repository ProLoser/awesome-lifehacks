# Coding

## Work Life Balance
It's difficult to code while context switching in and out of meetings and reviews. Sometimes challenges require digestion and feedback. The biggest blocker is lack of knowledge and decision making.

When COVID hit, most stores were only open in the middle of the afternoon. It forced me to attend meetings remotely while taking care of chores. I would then defer my programming to a separate window in my schedule. I would frequently spend multiple days deliberately avoiding programming to focus on meetings and chores and to polish my plan. When you finally sit down to code you will appreciate all the research and spec collection gathering and brainstorming you frontloaded.

Ask questions, take notes, and research while actively reviewing work of your teammates to keep them unblocked. Focus on reviews and teammate velocity. When your plan is ready, take a block of hours to disconnect from the world and focus purely on programming (or just going through emails)

I found my productivity increase reduced the need for coding sessions maybe once or twice a week. It's important to create situations where you can tunnel focus on the task at hand uninterrupted. When the plan and research is clear, your code will flow freely.

At the end of the day, you can only ask yourself to accomplish one thing. Move the needle. Hit the ball back into someone else's court. Not every ball, not every court. But challenge yourself with the lowest you can attain and see how far your momentum takes you.

## anti patterns
Code patterns are just tools. They are not typically good or bad, they are merely tools that we can choose to leverage or bias ourselves to avoid. Instead always be open to changing your perspective when given new information.

## Code Debt and Refactorability
The "R" word is not a 4 letter word although many managers seem to react that way.

Code debt exploration spikes although frequently incomplete are still extremely useful. I have left DRAFTs open years and find I am always able to come back and revisit this knowledge. Instead of forcing your team to adopt large painful changes, try to slice your draft into smaller pieces that can be used as fixes for bugs as they surface. This will help ground the effort in meaningful value for the end user and product managers.

Try to write code with the intention of refactoring. Anticipate future expectations of evolving behavior and try to adopt the relevant paradigms and patterns without increasing complexitly prematurely. It is always easier to make something simple more complicated than it is to make something complicated more simple.

Premature Optimization is like other Premature things... Emberrassing.

## 80/20 Rule
Focus on the 20% effort that would cover 80% of the results / users. Then identify the most frequent touch points when prioritizing remaining work.


## Peer Review
A code review is a conversation about a proposed change. It's a chance to share knowledge, identify potential issues, and improve the quality of the codebase. When reviewing code, try to be constructive and focus on the code, not the person. Ask questions instead of making demands. For example, instead of saying "This is wrong, do it this way", try "Have you considered this alternative approach? It might be more efficient because...".

Remember that the goal of a peer review is to improve the code, not to prove who is right or wrong. Be open to feedback on your own code and be willing to make changes.

## Interface Design
### Forgiveness vs Permission
In interface design, "forgiveness" means that the user can easily undo their actions. For example, a good interface will have an "undo" button or a "trash" can that allows users to recover deleted items. This makes users feel more comfortable exploring the interface and trying new things.

"Permission" on the other hand, means that the user is asked for confirmation before performing a potentially destructive action. For example, a dialog box that asks "Are you sure you want to delete this file?". While this can be useful in some cases, it can also be annoying if overused. A good interface will strike a balance between forgiveness and permission.

### minimalism and skeuomorphism
Minimalism in interface design is about removing unnecessary elements and focusing on the essential. This can make the interface cleaner, easier to use, and faster to load.

Skeuomorphism is the opposite of minimalism. It's about making digital objects resemble their real-world counterparts. For example, a notes app that looks like a yellow legal pad. While this can make the interface more familiar and intuitive, it can also make it look dated and cluttered.

`ctrl + R` in Terminal will allow you to search through your command history
