## Journaling is Cheaper than Therapy

A therapist is a friend you pay to listen to your life and share insights based on other people's lives in similar situations. A doctor is usually someone you briefly interact with when something goes wrong and then you dump all the recent context you think is relevant and they try to regurgitate a pill that magically makes it all go away.

It's impossible to have someone who knows every little detail of every context of your life. It is up to you to be your own doctor. 

If you find thoughts constantly spinning around in your head, WRITE THEM DOWN.

Typically we are too emotionally charged or too busy to be able to look at our problems with the added lens of perspective until we've actually gone through the physical process of expressing the thoughts from our body into physical form
