## Journaling is Cheaper than Therapy

A therapist is a friend you pay to listen to your life and share insights based on other people's lives in similar situations. A doctor is usually someone you briefly interact with when something goes wrong and then you dump all the recent context you think is relevant and they try to regurgitate a pill that magically makes it all go away.

It's impossible to have someone who knows every little detail of every context of your life. It is up to you to be your own doctor. 

If you find thoughts constantly spinning around in your head, WRITE THEM DOWN.

Typically we are too emotionally charged or too busy to be able to look at our problems with the added lens of perspective until we've actually gone through the physical process of expressing the thoughts from our body into physical form

## Chat with GPT
If you don't mind a technology company knowing everything about you, you can try chatting with an AI. They are great at digesting a large amount of information and giving suggestions based on that information and based on similar scenarios. 

They should always be interpreted as WRONG and never be fully relied upon to steer your life. technology will always fail or become compromised. it is not a matter of "if", it is a matter of "when".

So we must treat technology as merely another data point like every other anecdotal feedback or even a well researched "scholarly" article. we must take in all these considerations and let them simmer. distill your emotional response before sending. always give it at least one hour but up to 24 hours to simmer. the temporary emotions will fade, but your underlying reasoning for those emotions might remain. use that to steer your life, and do not add emotional weight to sunk cost it is merely another data point in life.
