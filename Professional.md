At work, people will attribute the way you communicate by some key traits. If you are proactive about growth, demonstrate your contrast to the passive and complacent.

### Complaining

Complaining usually makes you look less promotable because it signals negativity without offering solutions. It draws attention to problems but doesnâ€™t demonstrate initiative or problem-solving ability.

### Questioning

Shows curiosity and a willingness to learn, but it also demonstrates you may need to improve your information acquisition skills.

### Requesting

Framing gaps and problems around findings and reaching concrete solutions shows initiative and ownership.

### Resolving

It's easy to start projects and tasks. It's immensely more difficult to finish them. Focus on completing solutions, regardless of their size or nature.
